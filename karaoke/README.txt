README for lab - "The six o'clock alarm would never ring"
        by: Jay DeStories

1.)
This index.html displays an embedded copy of the music video
"Daydream Believer," accompanied by a title and a lyrics section which
dynamically changes as the song progresses.

The lyric section is dependent on the currentTime property of the song.
This value is checked whenever the event "timeupdate" occurs in the
music video object.

To my knowledge the lab has been fully and correctly implemented.

2.)
I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment.

3.)
I have spent approximately 1 hour on this assignment.
