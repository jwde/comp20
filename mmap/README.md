<h2>Assignment 2: Marauder's Map</h2>
<h3>By: Jay DeStories</h3>
<h3>What has been implemented</h3>
The webpage renders a google map, overlayed with the current location of the user, the current location of other students, and the current location of some characters.<br/>
It provides details in the form of an information window when any marker is clicked on, displays a polyline between the user and all characters on the map, and says the distances between the user and each character in a list below the map.
<br/><br/>
To my knowledge, everything has been implemented according to the specification.
