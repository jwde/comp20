<h1>Lab - Your News Feed</h1>
<h2>What has been implemented</h2>
The webpage has an input field. If text is entered into that field and the enter key is pressed, the message, with a timestamp, is added (without reloading) to the front of a list of messages below. All messages are stored in local storage and reloaded when the webpage is first loaded, so messages persist.
